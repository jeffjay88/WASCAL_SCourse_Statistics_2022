Hi!<br />

You're looking at the repository for the WASCAL SHORT COURSE on CLIMATE AND LAND USE DATA ANALYSIS AND APPLICATIONS, held at the WASCAL CLimate Change and Land Use (CCLU, KNUST) on the 19th and 20th December 2022.<br />



The repository contains the Jupyter (working) notebook which makes up the module 3 training material (with some trial exercises). <br />

Course overview<br />
The entire course spans a total of 2 days (4 modules) with the lecture sessions on Data Analysis and Statistics. <br />



<h2>Monday:</h2><br />
Exploratory Data Analysis; <br />
Time Series Modelling; <br />
Vector Autocorrection Model (VECM); <br />
Autoregressive Distributed Lag (ARDL) Cointegration Technique<br />

<h2>Tuesday:</h2><br />
Climate Statistics & Application:  <a href="SCourse_Data_Statistics.ipynb">SCourse_Data_Statistics.ipynb</a>; <br />
Validation Metrics; <br />
Spatial Econometric Analysis<br /> 



Getting started
To work through the course you will need three things on your computer: <br />

A copy of the course Jupyter notebooks <br />
A copy of the datasets weâ€™ll be working with <br />
A working environment with the necessary packages installed <br />
If you are having difficulty getting set up on your own computer you may click the "launch on binder"-link [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/jeffjay88/WASCAL_SCourse_Statistics_2022/master?labpath=SCourse_Data_Statistics.ipynb). Note: when you run the exercises on binder what you write will not be saved locally and so you will loose your work if you close the browser.

1. Downloading the notebooks to your computer<br />
The easiest way to get a copy of the notebooks on your computer is simply to clone this repository<br />

$> git clone https://github.com/jeffjay88/WASCAL_SCourse_Statistics_2022/ <br />
$> cd https://github.com/jeffjay88/WASCAL_SCourse_Statistics_2022/<br />

2. Download the datasets to your computer<br />
All the datasets used in this course are stored in the data directory:<br />


3. Setting up your environment<br />
To install the python packages you will be taught to use in this course you can use the pip "requirements-file" included in the course repository (it's called requirements.txt). First make sure you have pip/pip3 installed on your computer (instructions on how to install pip)<br />

$> python -m pip install pip3<br />

# You can also upgrade your pip package to the latest version<br />
$> python -m pip install --upgrade pip3<br />

You can install all the required packages.<br />
$> pip install requirements.txt<br />

You can now open up a Jupyter notebook session and get working on the notebooks.<br />
$>jupyter notebook<br />

We hope you enjoy the course!<br />
